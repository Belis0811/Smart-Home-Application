# Smart-Home-Application
android application control lights and humidity
Studied basic logic of Android programming, compiled codes to accomplish the data transmission function, and built the application’s UI to make it easier for users to operate and check data.
Coded to establish TCP link between the software and the hardware which is used to interact with STM32 develop a board to control LEDs by pressing buttons on the Smart Home application and read data from humidity and temperature sensor. These functions could help users conveniently control lights by pressing the screen’s button and reading room temperature and humidity by looking at the screen.
Cooperated with 3 teammates to realize the Login and Register function; formulated a function that used MD5 code to test if the password is correct when the user inputs the password which is safer and more accurate.
Tested the application by putting the hardware into multiple temperatures and humidity to ensure the reliability of software and hardware connection.
